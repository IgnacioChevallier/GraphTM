1. How are we supposed to know when a board has 1, 2, 5 moves left.
2. How many edges should nodes have? For us it made sense to have everything connected.
3. Why 75 open positions is used on the print board condition. Is that a threshold on how many moves are needed for a game to end? Only in a 11x11 right?
